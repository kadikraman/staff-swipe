# Staff swipe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Nifty little UI snippet to show how catering companies could choose employees via a Tinder-like swipecard UI.

Run the app: `yarn start`

This app uses a the [Airbnb eslint base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base) for linting and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code formatting. Run `yarn lint` for the linter and `yarn prettier` for prettier.
